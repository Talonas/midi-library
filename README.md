# MIDI library

Small and lightweight MIDI protocol library that allows transmit MIDI messages.

Originally, it was written for Arduino Uno in order to send MIDI messages to guitar effects that have MIDI inputs.

## Compiling
Arduino IDE could be used: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Be noticed - keep `*.ino` at the same directory with `midi.c` `midi.h` (using Arduino IDE only).

Also Makefile could be written or try `Arduino.mk` from https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/blob/master/Arduino.mk
